236,"DEI-based framings of this debate are silly, just as they would be if applied to nuclear weapons regulation.  Focus on existential risk."
237,"I think that, on the whole, the West is more advanced and is accelerating faster in AI development, compared to China"
238,"The biggest AI-related geopolitical risk is the US advancing AI first, and China either copying or stealing those innovations"

248,Communities affected by use of AI tools must have a say in decisions about their development or adoption
249,AI development should not be accelerated on the fear that China might get ahead of the US.
250,AI regulatory bodies should be created to rapidly respond to novel less-than-existential AI alignment failures while legislation catches up.
251,"More safety checks, peer review, and scrutiny from regulatory bodies, needs to happen before a Large singular AI training run even begins."
252,"If mass unemployment ensues from AI, expanding existing welfare programs is preferable to creating a universal basic income (UBI)."

282,Everyone should list their preference for maintaining their individuality as we become increasingly connected to AI and each other.
283,Predicting as far into the future as possible is critical for existential safety as it allows earlier detection and mitigation of threats.
284,"AIs potential to help solve major problems related to energy, health, & planetary risks make pausing AI development more risky than not."
285,"AIs should consider the effect their decisions will have on human freedom & autonomy balanced against on peace, harmony, and safety."
286,"Love in the forms of connection, tolerance, caring, and compassion are central human values that should be encouraged in AI training."
287,"Values used in training AIs, like those in Anthropic's Constitutional AI, should be voted on by a global electorate."
288,"The development of AI companions is net beneficial to humanity, and should correspondingly not be banned."
289,"A business imperative (i.e., profits, growth) must not be the driving force of AI innovation—look where that got us with social media"
290,"At some point we must consider consciousness/sentience and when AI might be ""awake"", potentially deserving ethical rights & considerations"

298,AI could aid in discovering production/extraction efficiencies (of scarce resources) and also accelerate human-caused environmental damage
299,"AI may perpetuate not only cultural bias, but an ontology that is capitalist/extractive/zero-sum—embedding unsustainable mindsets is a risk"
300,Steps must be taken to ensure that future technological developments do not concentrate power in the hands of the state or private companies
301,"In their current level of sophistication, LLMs like ChatGPT do not appear convincingly worrisome—it's what they imply will come next"
302,"Overreliance on AI may exacerbate a less skilled & less engaged citizenry; an agenda should ask how AI might supplement, but not replace us?"
303,"It is moral to use the threat of war to constrain development of AI, just like we use the threat of war to constrain nuclear development"
304,We should encourage nation-states to regulate AIs as if they were as risky as nuclear technology
305,"The most important thing is avoiding the death of the human race; everyday bias from AI models, while terrible, is far less important."
306,"Future AI models have the potential to lower expertise barriers for crafting biological weapons, which poses a significant global threat"
307,I think the development of AI will relate heavily to the cultural shifts present in our phase in history w/ institutional trust.
308,The use of AI in external and internal facing tools should be regulated differently.
309,Regulation of AI should be different for companies of different sizes.
310,"We need more pragmatic and less moralistic discussion on how to democratize AI (e.g., public funding (access) and IP reforms(innovation))"
311,We should discourage any use of AI to generate statements that look like facts.
312,I am supportive of the pursuit of AI superintelligence as a goal
313,"Greater focus should be placed on tackling the near-term risks of AI (bias, misinformation, etc.) than the existential risks."
314,"Greater priority should be awarded to educating the public on AI's societal impacts, including its incorporation into national curriculums"
315,Companies and institutions should be formally celebrated when they explicitly label interactions with them as AI or human-based
316,"Societies need to be preemptive and design for mass unemployment linked to AI, rather than wait and react after people start suffering"
317,"Governance of AI must pay attention to its material dimensions e.g. its energy demands, or the creation of physical infrastructure"
318,The costs of democratisation of developing and deploying AI outweigh the benefits
319,"I would accept less regulatory scrutiny of AI development and deployment, if it meant that AI services were cheaper to use"
320,Democratisation of the development and deployment of AI is inherently limited if we do not also democratise the ownership of its production.
321,Decisions about how this tech is developed should not lie solely in the hands of private companies and their employees
322,"Institutions, business and governments need to be transparent in the ways they use AI, we need legislation and regulation to secure this"
323,We should be very weary of AI models being trained on data previously generated by other AI models
324,The use of AI needs to be embraced within education systems to shift away from memorisation model to a critical and creative one
325,AI should be embraced for the public good. Private entities controlling either need to be open source or governed by a public body
326,AI's potential and pitfalls are overstated by AI 'experts'. The conversation about it shouldn't exclude opinions of everyone else
327,AI will create capacity in the labour market as it takes on easier repetitive tasks. This will should work with not against working reform
328,We need a permanent global deliberative forum for the regulation of AI development.
329,We must be careful not to conflate dangerous 'language hacking' potential of LLMs etc with the tremendous benefits of focussed AI tools.
330,The ability for frontier AI models to undermine democracy is an underaddressed problem.
331,"Global AI regulation needs to involve civil society, academia, industry and the open source community to get to the best possible outcome"
332,We need global standards in place to evaluate the environmental impact of AI technologies
333,"We need to foster better education and awareness of generative AI, it’s potential benefits and it’s limitations/biases."
334,Bias in training data is an area that needs to be urgently addresses to prevent the perpetuation of discrimination and cultural stereotypes
335,"Global AI regulation needs to empower the open source community as without it, it will be very difficult to have the right checks in place"
336,My work shows that the data used to train AI is the most important thing to focus on. We should regulate its use carefully.
337,I am nervous and pessimistic about the current direction of AI development.
338,"If we had a visual language for explaining AI systems to stakeholders, they would have more power to effect positive change."
339,"We need multiple approaches to governing AI, Focus on one too much means privileging some aspects of society over others."
340,Sovereign AI capacity is essential: it cannot just be private companies developing AI.
341,We need a single *international* approach to AI governance - national is not enough.
342,LLMs like ChatGPT and Bard should give the same answers to prompts in Pakistan as they do in California.
